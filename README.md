# Resume_Parser
Resume Parsing, is the conversion of a free-form CV/resume document into structured information â€” suitable for storage, reporting, and manipulation by a computer.
Resume parsers analyze a resume, extract the desired information, and insert the information into a database with a unique entry for each candidate. Once the resume has been analyzed, a recruiter can search the database for keywords and phrases and get a list of relevant candidates.
